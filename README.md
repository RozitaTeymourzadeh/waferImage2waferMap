=======================================
# waferImage2waferMap
waferImage2wafermap repository converts the image of wafer semiconductor into the wafer map to be used in factory line.
A wafer, also called a slice or substrate, is a thin slice of semiconductor material, such as a crystalline silicon, used in electronics for the fabrication of integrated circuits and in photovoltaics for conventional, wafer-based solar cells.(WikiPedia).
